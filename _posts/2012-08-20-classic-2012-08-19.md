<p>For my non-ballroom dancing readers, a brief explanation: &quot;Classic&quot; is an event held twice a year in which the students dance in front of a judge. The judge gives them a score 1-5 (1 being high) on how well they danced according to the level and age group they entered. </p>  <p>Students either dance with an instructor, or as a couple. Each leader (male or female) wearâ€™s a number on his or her back to distinguish the couples to the judge. Instructors are numbered with a red number, students with a black number, and generally are numbered starting from a different point separated by 100. (e.g. Students were numbered starting with 100, and instructors started from 1 for this classic)</p><p>And now, for some Videos from this Classic:</p>

<p>First up, a Waltz my wife (Jen) and I danced together:</p>
