I wanted to take a quick moment to share the full unedited version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OKGtbi4k8I" target="_blank">our waltz from Showcase</a> last week. First off, here is the full video we recorded from last Sunday, including some annotations I've added for context.

In the annotations above, I mention that we were a measure behind from where we had practiced it. Listen to the music below to see where things <b>should</b> have lined up with the music.

In the end, like I said, I think I almost prefer our ending the way it worked out the day of showcase. I just wish it weren't quite so nerve racking having to wait for the music to be cued up, and that it wasn't so quiet when it first started. But, as they say, "The show must go on!"
