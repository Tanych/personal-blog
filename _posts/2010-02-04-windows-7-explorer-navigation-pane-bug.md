title: Windows 7 Explorer Navigation Pane Bug
created: 1265273481

<p>So far, my experience with Windows 7 has largely been a positive one. I’m enjoying the new taskbar and all of the new “shiny” UI. (Note also that I was running Windows XP before switching to 7, so I wasn’t using Aero with Vista prior to using Windows 7)</p>  <p>One bug I have noticed that drives me crazy is the <a href="http://dumbwin.blogspot.com/2009/10/pain-that-is-navigation-pane-in-windows.html">navigation pane bug</a>. There have been <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/9923ece6-0ce5-46c0-8e43-bc9f2dacd484" target="_blank">several reports</a> that <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itproperf/thread/17a83954-8c3c-4d45-9dd6-03f6cdd1604c" target="_blank">others have filed</a> indicating that this is not new, nor is it isolated to just my machine. I have been able to consistently reproduce this bug with “Automatically expand to current folder” option on or off, so I don’t believe it is involved with the bug. I have created a <a href="http://www.jamesralexander.com/Downloads/FromBlog/NavigationPane_ScrollBarBug.mht" target="_blank">Problem Steps Recorder file</a>, and a youtube video showing the reproduction of this bug, hopefully this helps to resolve this issue.</p>
