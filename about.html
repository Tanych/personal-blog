## About

Hi, I'm Yecheng(Victor) Tan, a student at the George Washington University majoring Cybersecurity in computer science.I'm a backend developer and networking security analyst who works on campus as a student programmer at GW libraries. The open source project social media manager makes me grow up everyday.

Between 2012 to 2014, I was software engineer at the Fiberhome, where I focused on networking analysis and developing. Before that, I studied computer science at Hohai University and achieved the bachelor degree in computer science.

Please feel free to say Hi.
